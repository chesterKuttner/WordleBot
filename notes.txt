information is being represented in bits, when information is given that reduces the given probabibly by half its is reduced by one bit
if it is reduced too 1/4th the original probability its is reduced by 2 bits, the equation for this is:
(1/2)^I=p
which can be reduced too
I = log2(1/p(x))

therefore the optimism value we are giving to a certain word is calculated with this equation which incorporates all the possible words 
after one input

E[I] = âˆ‘ ( p(x) * log2(1/p(x)) )
       x
